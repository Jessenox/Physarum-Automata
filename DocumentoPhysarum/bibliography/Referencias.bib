abstract = {The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a large cell visible by the unaided eye. It behaves as an intelligent nonlinear spatially extended active medium encapsulated in an elastic membrane. The cell optimises its growth patterns in configurations of attractants and repellents. This behaviour is interpreted as computation. Numerous prototypes of slime mould computers were designed to solve problems of computational geometry, graphs and transport networks and to implement universal computing circuits. In this unique set of scientific photographs and micrographs, the leading experts in computer science, biology, chemistry and material science illustrate in superb detail the nature of the slime mould computers and hybrid devices. Every photograph or micrograph in this book is of real scientific, theoretical or technological interest. Each entry includes a self-contained description of how the visualised phenomenon is used in the relevant slime mould computer. This atlas is unique in providing the depth and breadth of knowledge in harnessing behaviour of the slime mould to perform computation. It will help readers to understand how exploitation of biological processes has sparked new ideas and spurred progress in many fields of science and engineering. Readership: Students and researchers interested in biological processes and computing.}

  abstract="The solutions to Traveling Salesman Problem can be widely applied in many real-world problems. Ant colony optimization algorithms can provide an approximate solution to a Traveling Salesman Problem. However, most ant colony optimization algorithms suffer premature convergence and low convergence rate. With these observations in mind, a novel ant colony system is proposed, which employs the unique feature of critical tubes reserved in the Physaurm-inspired mathematical model. A series of experiments are conducted, which are consolidated by two real-world Traveling Salesman Problems. The experimental results show that the proposed new ant colony system outperforms classical ant colony system, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm in efficiency and robustness.",

  abstract = {Creative systems such as algorithmic composers often use Artificial Intelligence models like Markov chains, Artificial Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms in order to model stochastic processes. Unconventional Computing (UC) technologies explore non-digital ways of data storage, processing, input, and output. UC paradigms such as Quantum Computing and Biocomputing delve into domains beyond the binary bit to handle complex non-linear functions. In this paper, we harness Physarum polycephalum as memristors to process and generate creative data for popular music. While there has been research conducted in this area, the literature lacks examples of popular music and how the organism's non-linear behaviour can be controlled while composing music. This is important because non-linear forms of representation are not as obvious as conventional digital means. This study aims at disseminating this technology to non-experts and musicians so that they can incorporate it in their creative processes. Furthermore, it combines resistors and memristors to have more flexibility while generating music and optimises parameters for faster processing and performance. },

MCPM is a probabilistic generalization of Jones's (2010) agent-based model for simulating the growth of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). We compare MCPM to Jones's work on theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe known as the cosmic web. To analyze the new model, we first explore MCPM's self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like morphologiesâ€”called polyphormsâ€”that the model produces from geometrically intuitive parameters. Applying MCPM to both simulated and observational cosmological data sets, we then evaluate its ability to produce consistent 3D density maps of the cosmic web. Finally, we examine other possible tasks where MCPM could be useful, along with several examples of fitting to domain-specific data as proofs of concept.}",

ABSTRACT = {Traditional artificial intelligence algorithms are prone to falling into local optima when solving threshold segmentation problems. Here, a novel artificial Physarum polycephalum colony algorithm is proposed to help us solve the difficult problem. First, the algorithm methodology of an artificial Physarum polycephalum colony algorithm is described to search for the optimal solutions by expansion and contraction of a lot of artificial hyphae. Different artificial Physarum polycephalum can learn from each other and produce more hyphae in expansion. In contraction, the artificial Physarum polycephalum colony can select the best hyphae with high fitness through a quick sort algorithm, but the other hyphae with low fitness will be absorbed and disappear. Second, a fitness function is modeled based on Kapur's entropy for the proposed artificial Physarum polycephalum colony algorithm to search for optimal threshold segmentation solutions. Third, a series of benchmark experiments are implemented to test the proposed artificial Physarum polycephalum colony algorithm, and some state-of-the-art approaches are employed for comparison. The experimental results verified that the proposed algorithm can obtain better accuracy and convergence speed, and is not easier to fall into the local optimal solution too early.},
