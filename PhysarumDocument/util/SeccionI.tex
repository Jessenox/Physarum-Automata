    \textbf{Abstract} - This project proposes the design and implementation of an automaton
        capable of determining trajectories in Euclidean spaces. The application of this system
        addresses challenges in autonomous navigation and real-time network design.
        Its relevance is highlighted in contexts such as in autonomous systems. The automaton
        will be implemented in a two-dimensional nonlinear model. This automaton could
        serve for the monitoring of population entities and related systems.
