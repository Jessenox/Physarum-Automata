    abstract = {Creative systems such as algorithmic composers often use Artificial Intelligence models like Markov chains, Artificial Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms in order to model stochastic processes. Unconventional Computing (UC) technologies explore non-digital ways of data storage, processing, input, and output. UC paradigms such as Quantum Computing and Biocomputing delve into domains beyond the binary bit to handle complex non-linear functions. In this paper, we harness Physarum polycephalum as memristors to process and generate creative data for popular music. While there has been research conducted in this area, the literature lacks examples of popular music and how the organism's non-linear behaviour can be controlled while composing music. This is important because non-linear forms of representation are not as obvious as conventional digital means. This study aims at disseminating this technology to non-experts and musicians so that they can incorporate it in their creative processes. Furthermore, it combines resistors and memristors to have more flexibility while generating music and optimises parameters for faster processing and performance. },

    abstract = "{We present Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM): a computational model suitable for reconstructing continuous transport networks from sparse 2D and 3D data. MCPM is a probabilistic generalization of Jones’s (2010) agent-based model for simulating the growth of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). We compare MCPM to Jones’s work on theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe known as the cosmic web. To analyze the new model, we first explore MCPM’s self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like morphologies—called polyphorms—that the model produces from geometrically intuitive parameters. Applying MCPM to both simulated and observational cosmological data sets, we then evaluate its ability to produce consistent 3D density maps of the cosmic web. Finally, we examine other possible tasks where MCPM could be useful, along with several examples of fitting to domain-specific data as proofs of concept.}",

    abstract = {In this article, an improved slime mould algorithm (SMA-CSA) is proposed for solving global optimization and the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This improvement is based on the mixed-strategy optimization of Cauchy mutation and simulated annealing to alleviate the lack of global optimization capability of the SMA. By introducing the Cauchy mutation strategy, the optimal solution is perturbed to increase the probability of escaping from the local extreme value; in addition, the annealing strategy is introduced, and the Metropolis sampling criterion is used as the acceptance criterion to expand the global search space to enhance the exploration phase to achieve optimal solutions. The performance of the proposed SMA-CSA algorithm is evaluated using the CEC 2013 benchmark functions and the capacitated vehicle routing problem. In all experiments, SMA-CSA is compared with ten other state-of-the-art metaheuristics. The results are also analyzed by Friedman and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The experimental results and statistical tests demonstrate that the SMA-CSA algorithm is very competitive and often superior compared to the algorithms used in the experiments. The results of the proposed algorithm on the capacitated vehicle routing problem demonstrate its efficiency and discrete solving ability.},

abstract = {The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a large cell visible by the unaided eye. It behaves as an intelligent nonlinear spatially extended active medium encapsulated in an elastic membrane. The cell optimises its growth patterns in configurations of attractants and repellents. This behaviour is interpreted as computation. Numerous prototypes of slime mould computers were designed to solve problems of computational geometry, graphs and transport networks and to implement universal computing circuits. In this unique set of scientific photographs and micrographs, the leading experts in computer science, biology, chemistry and material science illustrate in superb detail the nature of the slime mould computers and hybrid devices. Every photograph or micrograph in this book is of real scientific, theoretical or technological interest. Each entry includes a self-contained description of how the visualised phenomenon is used in the relevant slime mould computer. This atlas is unique in providing the depth and breadth of knowledge in harnessing behaviour of the slime mould to perform computation. It will help readers to understand how exploitation of biological processes has sparked new ideas and spurred progress in many fields of science and engineering. Readership: Students and researchers interested in biological processes and computing.}
